Gregg Jarrett , they did get a unanimous court for this decision .
Absolutely , Brian .
It was a very stern , very direct and it left no question *ICH*-1 , I think , in the minds of anybody that this court unanimously believes that certification should include the manual recount , and that is a clear victory for Vice President Al Gore .
The language here , really leaves no doubt .
The right *ICH*-1 of the people *PRO* to cast their vote , the court said 0 *?* , is paramount .
The amended certifications must be accepted *-1 by November 26 .
The reason 0 they are picking that particular day *T*-1 is 0 it allows , Brian , enough time for the aggrieved party , the losing party to file within 10 days a contest of the certification and that still allows enough time for the contest to be litigated *-2 through the courts primarily the circuit court and back to the Supreme Court if necessary and still meet the December 12 deadline for the Electoral College vote here .
Now , Greg , the only question that *T*-1 mean means anything at this hour .
We know 0 their view is 0 the hand counts should now be included *-2 .
Will it put Al Gore over the top in the race *PRO* to match and exceed the votes of George W. Bush ?
It very well could *?* , although , I must say that the Gore campaign has been somewhat disappointed by the number of votes 0 they have not received *T*-1 thus far in the counties that *T*-2 are undertaking the manual recounts , Brian , but a lot of hand counts still must be tallied *-3 .
We are also including the undervotes of 10,000 in Palm Beach and junt votes of 10,000 in Miami - Dade as well .
*PRO* Keep in mind , 0 those were not registered *-1 by the computers because they either had a hanging chad or dimpled chad .
Those must be gone over *-1 by hand by each respective canvassing board .
So there are a lot of votes remaining there .
This is a Gore campaign to the White House .
Greg , just a logistic question , How long is it *EXP*-3 going *-1 take you *T*-2 *PRO* to get the opinion run to you from the building behind you ?
I would say 0 we should have it here in the next five minutes .
It depends how quickly the line moves *T*-1 .
We have two producers , I believe 0 *?* , near the front of the line .
It how quickly they get handed *T*-1 .
It reversed the two orders of the earlier trial court , Circuit Court Judge Terry Lewis .
The bottom line , this court rules unanimously 0 the right *ICH*-1 of the people *PRO* to have the votes counted *-2 is paramount , thus , the amended certifications *PRO* to include the hand counts must be accepted *-3 by November 26 .
In fact , it seemed *-1 to have some language here .
In fact , Brian I do have it handed *-1 to me now .
*PRO* Let me take a the .
Brian , if for some reason the Secretary of State would n't accept by the 26th , the certification , it could be certified *-1 elsewhere .
Gregg Jarrett .
I should point out , 0 he is a former lawyer himself and so can help *PRO* put this into English .
Greg , *PRO* go ahead , if you come to a passage 0 we should hear *T*-1 .
I 'm flipping through the summary of enacts because that is not important .
The summary of facts .
You flag us when you come to the first portion 0 we should hear *T*-1 aloud *T*-2 .
