Good evening , everyone .
We begin tonight with a couple of urgent questions for the government .
There 's a man on trial in New York for *PRO* bombing the American embassy in Kenya two years ago .
The FBI says 0 when they questioned him *T*-1 , he told them of another plot *PRO* to bomb an American ship in Yemen , where the `` USS Cole '' was ultimately attacked *-3 *T*-2 .
Question one , did the FBI make it *EXP*-1 clear what the man had told them *T*-2 ?
Question two , did the Pentagon and the CIA get the message and do nothing about it ?
Here 's *T*-1 your national correspondent , John M Wethy .
In the days after the bombing of the American embassy in Nairobi , Mohammed Al - owhali was arrested *-1 by Kenyan authorities and interrogated *-1 by the FBI .
He told the FBI 0 he participated in the attack under direction of terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden .
ABC News has learned 0 he also provided details of a plan *PRO* to attack an American warship in Yemen .
Al - owhali said 0 it would be a rocket attack , conducted * by a Bin Laden terrorist cell , and it would come in the next few months .
The next morning , August 1998 , the FBI sent out a classified message , under Director Louis Freeh 's name , warning of a plot *PRO* to attack a U.S. Navy ship in Yemen .
The FBI message went to three Pentagon agencies , and as a result , the visit of one American warship to Yemen was canceled *-1 .
The warning came as General Anthony Zinni was finalizing an agreement for *PRO* refueling ships in the Yemeni port of Aden .
It apparently left no lasting impression .
Zinni testifying after the attack on the `` USS Cole '' -- Aden never had a specific terrorist threat .
All the other ports that *T*-1 have been mentioned *-2 here that we should have considered *T*-3 as options have had specific threats .
So what *T*-1 happened to the FBI warning ?
CIA officials say 0 they never received it .
FBI officials say 0 they did copy the CIA .
Pentagon officials say 0 they got the warning , but had no idea 0 it the source was such a well - connected insider within Bin Laden 's organization .
This raises a fundamental question -- if the message had been more clearly communicated and understood *-1 , would American lives have been saved *-2 ?
John M Wethy , ABC News , the Pentagon , *PRO*-1 still looking for answers .
