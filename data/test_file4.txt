In the other major story out of the Middle East , Arab Foreign Ministers met today in Cairo in advance of Saturday 's Arab 's summit .
Egypt called the emergency summit *PRO*-1 to declare support for the Palestinians in the wake of three weeks of violence that *T*-2 has left at least 106 people *PRO*-3 dead , almost all of them Palestinian .
Violence has abated somewhat since the deal was struck *-1 at Sharm el - Sheikh two days ago , but Arab governments are under pressure *ICH*-2 from their own citizens *PRO*-3 to take a tough stance against Israel .
James Drummond , covering the Arab summit in Cairo for the Financial Times .
James , there 's a reason why the Arabs wanted this pre-summit meeting *T*-1 .
What is the pressure on them *T*-1 prior to the summit ?
Well , I think 0 they want *PRO*-1 to try and iron out any potential difficulties before the heads of state come into town on Saturday and Sunday .
So this is a preparatory exercise *PRO* to reach some sort of agreement beforehand .
Of course , the problem is that not all Arab states are speaking again with one voice .
What do they hope *PRO*-1 to achieve *T*-2 ? and what can you claim *T*-3 from the statements made * today ?
It *EXP*-1 is difficult *PRO* to say , Arab 's summit have traditionally been exercises in division .
We have already seen problems from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi *ICH*-1 on Tuesday who *PRO*-2 appeared on Al - Jazeera , the pan-Arab satellite channel , and he , rubbish , what he said *T*-3 was a draft statement for the end of the summit on Sunday .
And he was very categorical that it was too weak and did not harm Israeli interests sufficiently .
So we have Gadafi on the one hand .
On the other hand we have Egypt which *T*-1 was the first Arab country 0 *T*-2 to make peace with the Jewish state , which *T*-3 is of course also a top recipient of US aid .
The Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is more of a voice of moderation against the other side .
*PRO* Tell us about what he has been saying *T*-1 .
Well , Mr. Mubarak has been , as you say *?* , a voice of moderation .
He has invested an awful amount in the peace with Israel , and really he can not afford *PRO*-1 to let it fail .
We have seen some more power techniques perhaps from his Foreign Minister Amre Moussa over the last few weeks , but Amre Moussa today at the Foreign Minister 's meeting was calling simply for the return of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians , in stark contrast to Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al - Shara who *T*-1 was pulling for a complete cut in diplomatic relations between Israel and the two Arab states that *T*-2 happen .
So Egypt is playing a calming role .
It will not want *PRO*-1 to see anything too strong coming out of this summit due * to end on Sunday .
What *T*-1 seemed *-2 to be the prevailing voices at this point ?
There are certainly calls for war against Israel .
Is there much support for that ?
Well , actually President Mubarak was very categorical *ICH*-4 today in *PRO*-1 condemning calls for war , which he said 0 *T*-2 were very serious and people should understand the implications of just what it meant *T*-3 .
Egypt and Jordan do not want *PRO*-1 to see any sort of conventional war against Israel .
They have both invested enormous amounts in it , and both regimes would be more vulnerable if the peace process were *-1 to fail , because detractors and opponents within each country would have ammunition by which *PRO*-3 to fire at them *T*-2 .
How much is the United States entering into the conversation *T*-1 and how much pressure *T*-2 seems *-3 to be coming from the United States ?
Well today not too much .
I mean Madeleine Albright was in Saudi Arabia *ICH*-1 yesterday where she met with crown prince Abdullah and the new Syrian President Bashar Al - Assad *T*-2 .
Interestingly enough she is quoted *-1 as *PRO*-1 telling General Sanholi back to the US that she did not really get too much of a reception from Bashar Al - Assad in terms of *PRO* lightening the traditionally antagonistic Syrian align towards Israel .
Nonetheless , the fact that she did meet with Bashar Al - Assad and it was n't Saudi Arabia which *T*-1 is traditionally being more dovish and has supported US policy , it is significant .
So , as of today , I would say certainly 0 on the surface there has been little US action .
Well , *PRO* thank you very much for the update .
James Drummond , correspondent for the Financial Times of London speaking to us from Cairo .
*PRO* Thank you James .
Thanks .
